DATABASE MIGRATION NOTES
========================

After running this script, you'll need to create Django migrations for the model changes:

1. Create migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py makemigrations accounts
   ```

2. Review the generated migration file carefully. You may need to:
   - Add a data migration to rename the database table from 'accounts_recoverybuddy' to 'accounts_recoverypal'
   - Update any foreign key references
   - Handle any custom database constraints

3. Example custom migration operations to add:
   ```python
   operations = [
       migrations.RenameModel(
           old_name='RecoveryBuddy',
           new_name='RecoveryPal',
       ),
       migrations.RenameField(
           model_name='user',
           old_name='buddy_relationships_as_user1',
           new_name='pal_relationships_as_user1',
       ),
       migrations.RenameField(
           model_name='user',
           old_name='buddy_relationships_as_user2',
           new_name='pal_relationships_as_user2',
       ),
   ]
   ```

4. Apply migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

5. Update any existing data in the database if needed.

6. Clear cache:
   ```bash
   python manage.py clear_cache
   ```

7. Restart your development server.
