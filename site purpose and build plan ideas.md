## Prompt
Use the github rep and attached files for reference. Reviewing the site, how can it be made to focus more on the community aspect. I'd like the site to be more about connecting people in recovery and people effected by those in addiction. Like social media for that segment of the population. Lets start with 1. Start with the Activity Feed: This will immediately make the site feel more social. When creating files, make sure not to lose any important information or functionality that's already there by reviewing the original files. If you can't find a file to use as an example, ask me if there's a file and to attach it.

I'll help you analyze your recovery website and suggest ways to enhance the community focus. Let me first search through your project knowledge to understand the current structure and then provide specific recommendations.Based on my analysis of your MyRecoveryPal website structure and files, I can see you have a solid foundation with Django-based user authentication, blogging, journaling, resources, and basic community features. Here's how you can transform it into a more community-focused social platform for recovery:

## **Current Community Features Assessment**
Your site already has:
- User profiles with recovery-specific fields
- Basic messaging system (SupportMessage model)
- Blog posts with comments
- Milestone tracking
- Community page template

## **Key Recommendations to Enhance Community Focus**

### **1. Enhanced Social Feed & Activity Stream**
Transform the dashboard into a social media-style feed:
- **Activity Feed**: Show recent posts, milestones, comments from followed users
- **Community Timeline**: Mix of personal stories, milestone celebrations, and resource shares
- **Real-time Updates**: Use WebSockets for live notifications and updates

### **2. Expanded User Connections**
Build deeper relationship features:
- **Follow/Following System**: Let users follow others' journeys
- **Sponsor/Sponsee Relationships**: Formal mentorship connections
- **Recovery Pals**: Mutual support partnerships
- **Interest-based Groups**: Support groups by addiction type, location, recovery stage

### **3. Interactive Community Features**
Add social engagement tools:
- **Recovery Check-ins**: Daily mood/status updates with emoji reactions
- **Group Challenges**: 30-day sobriety challenges, wellness goals
- **Virtual Meetings**: Integration with video chat for support groups
- **Photo Sharing**: Before/after recovery photos, milestone celebrations
- **Story Reactions**: Beyond likes - "inspiring," "relatable," "helpful" reactions

### **4. Enhanced Discovery & Matching**
Help users find their community:
- **Smart Recommendations**: Suggest users with similar recovery journeys
- **Location-based Connections**: Find local recovery community members
- **Experience Matching**: Connect people with similar addiction backgrounds
- **Recovery Stage Grouping**: Early recovery vs. long-term recovery communities

### **5. Gamification & Community Engagement**
Increase participation through:
- **Community Reputation Points**: Earned through helpful posts, comments, support
- **Badge System**: "30 Days Clean," "Mentor," "Story Teller," "Supportive Friend"
- **Leaderboards**: Most supportive community members (carefully designed to be positive)
- **Community Goals**: Collective milestone tracking

### **6. Family & Support Network Integration**
Extend beyond just people in recovery:
- **Family Accounts**: For loved ones affected by addiction
- **Support Circles**: Private groups for families/friends
- **Educational Resources**: For those supporting someone in recovery
- **Communication Tools**: Safe ways for families to stay connected during recovery

## **Technical Implementation Priorities**

### **Phase 1: Core Social Features (2-4 weeks)**
1. **Follow System**: Add following relationships to User model
2. **Activity Feed**: Create feed algorithm showing followed users' activities  
3. **Enhanced Profiles**: Add profile photos, detailed recovery stories
4. **Improved Messaging**: Real-time chat features

### **Phase 2: Group Features (3-6 weeks)**
1. **Support Groups**: Create group models and management
2. **Group Chat**: Multi-user messaging within groups
3. **Event System**: Virtual meetings, check-ins, challenges
4. **Content Sharing**: Easy sharing of posts between groups

### **Phase 3: Advanced Community (6-8 weeks)**
1. **Video Integration**: For virtual meetings and story sharing
2. **Mobile App Development**: React Native or Flutter app
3. **Push Notifications**: Real-time engagement alerts
4. **Advanced Matching**: AI-powered community suggestions

## **Mobile Strategy**

For mobile compatibility, I recommend:

**Option 1: Progressive Web App (PWA)**
- Faster to implement
- Uses existing Django backend
- Offline functionality
- Push notifications
- App-like experience

**Option 2: Native Mobile App**
- Better performance
- More native features (camera, location)
- App store presence
- Dedicated mobile team needed

## **Revenue Model Considerations**

Structure your free/paid tiers around community features:

**Free Tier:**
- Basic profiles and messaging
- Public groups (limited)
- Standard milestone tracking

**Premium Tier:**
- Private groups and advanced matching
- Unlimited messaging
- Video calls and premium resources
- Priority support and mentor matching

**Family/Supporter Tier:**
- Multi-account family plans
- Educational resources for supporters
- Family communication tools

## **Privacy & Safety Features**

Critical for recovery community:
- **Anonymous Options**: Allow partial anonymity while maintaining community
- **Content Moderation**: AI + human moderation for sensitive content
- **Crisis Support Integration**: Quick access to professional help
- **Blocking/Reporting**: Robust tools to maintain safe environment

## **Next Steps**

1. **Start with the Activity Feed**: This will immediately make the site feel more social
2. **Enhance User Profiles**: Add photos, detailed recovery stories, interests
3. **Implement Following System**: Core social feature that enables everything else
4. **Add Group Functionality**: Support groups are essential for recovery communities
5. **Focus on Mobile Experience**: Ensure responsive design or begin app development
